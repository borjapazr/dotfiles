## ℹ️ About

Personal .dotfiles for quick configuration of my UNIX-based devices. They are tailored to my needs and do not claim to be the right solution for ideal .dotfiles.

> 💡 As a starting point to get all your configuration files and scripts organised I recommend you to use [dotly](https://github.com/CodelyTV/dotly), which is a project that describes itself as a simple and fast dotfiles framework.

## 📥 Installation

Using `wget`:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borjapazr/dotfiles/HEAD/installer)
```

Or using `curl`:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borjapazr/dotfiles/HEAD/installer)
```

### 🧸 Configuration

Read [this](doc/installation-guide.md) page.

## 📋 Features

### ⚒️ Built with

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout...
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) A general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
- [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) Dotbot is a tool that bootstraps your dotfiles (it's a [Dot]files [bo]o[t]strapper, get it?). It does less than you think, because version control systems do more than you think.

### 🌚 The `dot` command

`dot` is the core command my .dotfiles. If you execute it, you'll see all your scripts.

```bash
[mars] ~ dot -h
Usage:
   dot
   dot <context>
   dot <context> <script> [<args>...]
   dot -h | --help
   dot -p | --print
```
